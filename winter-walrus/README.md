# Winter Walrus ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Winter Walrus is a liquid staking protocol built on top of Walrus Native Staking.

## Overview

Winter Walrus is a framework to mint $WAL LSTs. Currently we support the LSTs below:

-   wWal: [native Winter Walrus LST](https://x.com/walrusLST).
-   upWal: by [Double Up](https://www.doubleup.fun/).
-   mWal: by [Studio Mirai](https://sm.xyz/)
-   pWal: by [Patara](https://patara.app/)
-   breadWal: by [Mr. Breadsmith](https://x.com/MrBreadSmith)
-   nWal by [Sui Nigeria Community](https://x.com/SuiNetworkNG)

Each LST issuer has full admin rights over it. They decide which validators to allocate to and the fees.

Winter Walrus frontend is available at [www.winterwalrus.com](https://www.winterwalrus.com/) and [open sourced on Github](https://github.com/interest-protocol/winterwalrus.com). Users experience near-instant Web2 UX with 0ms latency.

## Why?

Walrus uses a **delegated proof of Stake** for consensus. Users can natively stake WAL and receive a NFT named **StakedWal** that represents their position. The issue is that StakedWal is not fungible, you cannot use it to swap, lend or leverage.

Winter Walrus solves this issue by keeping custody of the **StakedWal** on a Shared Object to mint Liquid Staking Coins. Now users are able to interact with DeFi while earning passive staking income.

## Epoch Mechanics

Winter Walrus operates on a delegated proof-of-stake system structured into epochs, each lasting two weeks. The timing of staking within an epoch determines the rewards and type of asset received:

-   **Staking before 50% of epoch progress:** Users mint an LST and are eligible for the next epoch rewards.
-   **Staking after 50% of epoch progress:** Users receive a burnable NFT, which can be converted into the respective LST one epoch later.

## Admin Rights

Winter Walrus employs a SuperAdmin Key system:

-   **SuperAdmin Key:** Can create and remove admins.
-   **Admin (Key + Store):** Manages stake, unstake, and transmute fees.
-   **SuperAdmin Transfers:** Require a two-epoch function execution for security purposes.

## Security

Winter Walrus was audited by [MoveBit](https://www.movebit.xyz/). You can find the audit report [here](https://1728454349-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FRWtS0P2EGEpzNUGZyx31%2Fuploads%2Fvi7dgNYPSMEBYyQglM9l%2FBlizzard%20Audit%20Repor.pdf?alt=media&token=bfbab48f-19a9-4b56-94b5-44b2d6abda18).

The current Admin capabilities are held in a hardware wallet. We plan to move to a multi-signature wallet in the future.

## API Reference

**sync_exchange_rate:** Synchronizes the exchange rate for the entire staking system.
**Errors**
-   If you hit the maximum dynamic reads. Please use **sync_node_exchange_rate:**

```move
public fun sync_exchange_rate<T>(self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>, walrus_staking: &Staking)
```

**sync_node_exchange_rate:** Synchronizes the exchange rate for a specific node.

```move
public fun sync_node_exchange_rate<T>(
    self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>,
    walrus_staking: &Staking,
    node_id: ID,
)
```

**mint:** Mints LST tokens by staking WAL tokens to a specific node.

**Errors**
-   You are not allowed to deposit less than 1 WAL + fees.
-   Must mint **before** the epoch mid point.

```move
public fun mint<T>(
    self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>,
    walrus_staking: &mut Staking,
    wal_coin: Coin<WAL>,
    node_id: ID,
    av: &AllowedVersions,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): Coin<T>
```

**mint_after_votes_finished:** Mints a burnable NFT when staking after votes are finished in the epoch.

**Errors**
-   You are not allowed to deposit less than 1 WAL + fees.
-   Must mint **after** the epoch mid point.

```move
public fun mint_after_votes_finished<T>(
    self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>,
    walrus_staking: &mut Staking,
    wal_coin: Coin<WAL>,
    node_id: ID,
    av: &AllowedVersions,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): BlizzardStakeNFT
```

**burn_stake_nft:** Burns a stake NFT to convert it into LST tokens.

**Errors**
-   Must burn on the epoch after minting or later.

```move
public fun burn_stake_nft<T>(
    self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>,
    walrus_staking: &Staking,
    nft: BlizzardStakeNFT,
    av: &AllowedVersions,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): Coin<T>
```

**burn_lst:** Burns LST tokens to withdraw WAL tokens and StakedWal NFTs.

**Errors**
-   Burn more than 1 LST

```move
public fun burn_lst<T>(
    self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>,
    walrus_staking: &mut Staking,
    lst_coin: Coin<T>,
    withdraw_ixs: vector<IX>,
    av: &AllowedVersions,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,

```

**transmute:** Converts one LST type to another LST type (e.g., from any LST to WWAL).

**Errors**
-   Transmute more than 1 LST + fees.

```move
public fun transmute<T>(

    value: u64,
    round_up: bool,
): Option<u64>
```

**to_wal_at_epoch:** Converts LST value to WAL value at a specific epoch.

```move
public fun fee_config<T>(self: &mut BlizzardStaking<T>): &BlizzardFee
```

**new:** It creates a `ACL`and `SuperAdmin`. The SuperAdmin is sent to the `super_admin_recipient`. The `delay` is the number of epochs that must pass before the SuperAdmin can be `transferred`.

```move
public fun new<T: drop>(
    otw: &T,
    delay: u64,
